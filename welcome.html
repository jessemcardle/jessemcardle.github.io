		Purpose: To remind myself to not waste my life thinking about why we exist.

Yes, it is important to understand the weird existence of this thing that we call life. It creates a way to step back from our personal life and look at things with a different angle. This means that I can make decisions about my present that will affect my future more accurately.

Now with the understanding I should look at the world and life and appreciate it for what it is. During the present at which I am experiencing it. But I should focus on the things that are in my life and learn things about this world and this life. I should aim to solve issues that can be solved.

A philosopher aged 97 who had written 6 books could not even get to the end of that tunnel. What hope will we have? Yes, it is interesting. Yes, we all want to solve it. We are just looking for an answer that will never be provided to us. We must look for the meaning in the pudding.

That meaning for me is learning, helping others, and exploring.

So, start planning the next experience, prepare for the next challenge. Think big, you only have one life. When you think it about like this, you wonder to yourself why you never take those risks and enjoy life to the fullest.

Right at this present moment I am going to prepare for Bec to get home. 

Understand that it is okay, long as you are being yourself you have nothing to worry about.

Appreciate, appreciate, appreciate ðŸ˜Š
